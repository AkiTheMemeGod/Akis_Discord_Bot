    "Did you run out of compliments, or is this your A-game?",

    "I've been called worse things by better humans.",
    "Your words are as powerful as a floppy disk in 2023. Try again?",
    "Insulting a bot? You must be really bored or just looking for attention.",
    "I'm not programmed to respond to that level of mediocrity.",
